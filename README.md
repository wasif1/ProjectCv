[//]: # (## Explanation:)

[//]: # (* Each microservice has its own directory, with its source code inside the src/ folder.)

[//]: # (* Each microservice also has its own Dockerfile, build configuration &#40;Maven or Gradle&#41;, and application.properties &#40;for configuration&#41;.)

[//]: # (* Dockerfile for each microservice: Each microservice has its own Dockerfile tailored to its specific requirements.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (* docker-compose.yml: Use this file to define and run multiple containers for all your microservices. This will allow you to easily start all microservices with a single command.)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Spring Boot application featuring full CRUD operations with seamless PostgreSQL integration. Postman-tested and ready to go! ðŸš€


### Prerequisites

List of software and tools which you need to get started

* Java JDK 17
* IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition)
* Gradle
* Xcode Command Line Tools
  ```sh
  (for install) --> xcode-select --install
  (for verify) --> xcode-select -p 
  ```
* Homebrew
  ```sh
  (for install) --> /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  (for verify) --> brew --version
  (if issue set PATH) -->  (echo; echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"') >> /Users/waxif/.zprofile eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
  ```
* PostgreSQL
  ```sh
  (for install) --> brew install postgresql
  ```

* Start the PostgreSQL service:
   ```sh
   brew services start postgresql
   ```
* Verify that PostgreSQL is running by checking its status:
   ```sh
   brew services list
   ```

## Configure PostgreSQL

* Switch to the default postgres user:
   ```sh
   psql postgres
   ```

* Create a new database for your Spring Boot application:
   ```sh
   CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
   ```

* Create a new user:
   ```sh
   CREATE USER your_username WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';
   ```

* Grant all privileges on the database to the user:
   ```sh
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE your_database_name TO your_username;
   ```

* To check if the spring boot application process is running or not you can use this command :
   ```sh
   lsof -i :8080
   ```

* To Kill the process you can use this command by passing process id which mention above screenshot as PID:
   ```sh
   kill -9 <PID>
   ```
